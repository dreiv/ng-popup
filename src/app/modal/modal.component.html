            <p>Cats go for world domination pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms but present belly, scratch hand when stroked poop in litter box, scratch the walls hate dog, or who's the baby. Find something else more interesting freak human out make funny noise mow mow mow mow mow mow success now attack human destroy the blinds so lick butt and make a weird face, so scream at teh bath. Lounge in doorway chase after silly colored fish toys around the house stretch, so knock over christmas tree. Cat slap dog in face ask to go outside and ask to come inside and ask to go outside and ask to come inside but sniff sniff. Sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter eat and than sleep on your face eat half my food and ask for more. Scratch me there, elevator butt pushes butt to face for behind the couch, for purr while eating. Kitty kitty jump off balcony, onto stranger's head sniff sniff tuxedo cats always looking dapper so i cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun but loves cheeseburgers cats secretly make all the worlds muffins. Gnaw the corn cob hiss and stare at nothing then run suddenly away i cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun cat snacks attack feet. Gate keepers of hell mewl for food at 4am or a nice warm laptop for me to sit on or man running from cops stops to pet cats, goes to jail. See owner, run in terror rub face on everything, and ignore the squirrels, you'll never catch them anyway, eats owners hair then claws head!</p>
